INSTRUCTIONS

This program is intended to be ran using the MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator (MARS). When the user presses 
the run program button, they are met with a user input prompt. It will ask how tall(in rows) the triangle will be.
Only numbers greater than 0 are permitted or the user will be asked to give a different number. After that, a triangle 
will be outputed for the user with their inputted height.
