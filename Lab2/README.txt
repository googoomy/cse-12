Lab 2: Simple Data Path

-----------------------------------------------------------
DESCRIPTION

In this lab, the user can either input with the keypad or the ALU output with the Store Select switch. Based on the input,
the user can write their input into either of the four registers using the Write Address switches and the update switch. Based on the 
Read Address 1 and 2, two registers will be input into the ALU. The first input will be put under a left bit-wise rotation the 
same number of times as the second input's value which results in the ALU output.

INSTRUCTIONS

Lab2.lgi is intended to be ran through Multimedia Logic (MMLogic or MML). When the user presses the play button, 
they can choose an input with the Store Select switch and assign a their input value to any of the registers.
They can also choose two of the registers which will be the inputs for the ALU and will update the ALU output.
